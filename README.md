This file outlines the code submission for Milestone 1 from team Matrix.

RELEASE NOTES
	Added street model to the simulation.
	Added rough temporary models for cars to the sim.
	Added code to the simulation for car and pedestrian behavior.
	Added waypoint system to the program.

	Code included in this submission is preliminary and demonstrates basic
	use of the waypoint system and traffic flow that will be used in the overall
	program. There is a low-level AI running that designates traffic flow and
	object behavior in the simulation.

This file outlines the code submission for Milestone 4 from team Matrix.

RELEASE NOTES
	Added Car Waypoints.
	Added Car exits.
	Added Pedestrian waypoints.
	Added Pedestrian exits.
	Added sidewalks to baxter model.
	Added starting parking lot lines.
	Added a FPS meter to monitor proformance
	Updated spawners.
	Updated waypoint nav script.


The end goal for this project is to be able to simulate traffic flow and
pedestrian interaction with traffic using the waypoint system and basic
AI.
